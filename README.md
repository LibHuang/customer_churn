# Telecom Customer Churn Prediction

## Overview
This project predicts **customer churn** in the telecom industry using machine learning.  
By analyzing a telecom churn dataset, it identifies key drivers of churn and applies multiple classification models to evaluate predictive performance.  

The goal is to help telecom providers **flag high-risk customers early** and design **targeted retention strategies** to reduce revenue loss.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Steps Performed
1. **Data Loading & Exploration**
   - Imported churn dataset
   - Reviewed dataset size and structure
   - Explored churn distribution and customer demographics

2. **Data Visualization**
   - Histograms comparing churn vs. non-churn groups:
     - Monthly Charges
     - Total Charges
     - Streaming / Internet services  

3. **Modeling**
   - Implemented multiple ML models:
     - Logistic Regression  
     - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
     - Decision Tree  
     - Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
     - Ensemble models (Random Forest, Bagging, AdaBoost)  
     - Boosting models (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost)  

4. **Model Evaluation**
   - Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC  
   - Generated ROC curves for best-performing models

## üìä Results & Findings
- **Top Models**  
  - Boosting algorithms (**XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost**) achieved the **highest ROC-AUC scores**.  
  - Random Forest also performed strongly compared to baseline models.  

- **Key Features**  
  - **Monthly Charges** and **Total Charges** were the most predictive.  
  - Customers with **higher monthly charges** and **shorter tenure** were more likely to churn.  
  - Service-related features (e.g., streaming, internet plans) influenced churn.  

- **Business Insights**  
  - High-risk customers can be proactively identified.  
  - Implementing **retention offers** (discounts, loyalty programs, or plan adjustments) could reduce churn and protect recurring revenue.
